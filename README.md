# Heart Disease Prediction Project
## Introduction
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using a machine learning model. The model is trained on a dataset containing various health metrics and uses this data to make predictions. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, and a web application to interact with the model and make predictions.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease dataset Downloaded from the Kaggle. It contains 14 features related to heart health, such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and others.
## Model Description
The prediction model is built using several machine learning algorithms. The final model is selected based on performance metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and RÂ² score. The main algorithms considered include:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- SVM
- Random Forest
